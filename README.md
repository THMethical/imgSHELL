# imgSHELL
Writes a shell to an image


The "imgSHELL" tool is a graphical user interface that allows injecting a shell script into a JPEG image and checking the success of the operation. The tool uses the Exiftool and Strings tools to inject the shell script into the image and search for a specific string after a successful injection.
